      <h2>Growth Over the Years</h2>
      <p>
        Over the years, "A Little Scoop of Happiness" has grown beyond our wildest dreams. What began as a single cart has blossomed into multiple storefronts, each one a beacon of sweet joy in its community. Our menu has expanded to include a wide array of flavors, from classic favorites to innovative new creations. We've added seasonal and specialty flavors, ensuring there's always something new to delight our customers' palates.

      <p>
        Our growth has been fueled by a relentless dedication to quality and customer satisfaction. We've invested in state-of-the-art equipment and training for our team to maintain the highest standards in every scoop we serve. Our shops are more than just places to buy ice cream; they are welcoming spaces where families and friends gather to create lasting memories. This growth is a testament to the love and support of our community, and we are deeply grateful for every customer who has been part of our journey.
