        <p className="sourcing-text">Our sourcing practices are rooted in a commitment to quality, sustainability, and ethical treatment of workers. Here’s how we ensure the best ingredients for our gelato:</p>
        <ul className="sourcing-list">
          <li className="sourcing-item">
            <strong>Ethical Partnerships:</strong> We build relationships with farmers and suppliers who share our values. This ensures fair wages and ethical treatment of workers at every stage of production. We believe that fair trade practices lead to better quality ingredients and a better world.
          </li>
          <li className="sourcing-item">
            <strong>Sustainable Farming:</strong> We prioritize ingredients from farms that practice sustainable agriculture. This includes crop rotation, organic farming, and minimal use of pesticides and fertilizers. Sustainable farming practices not only protect the environment but also produce healthier, more flavorful ingredients.
          </li>
          <li className="sourcing-item">
            <strong>Local Sourcing:</strong> Whenever possible, we source ingredients from local farms. This supports the local economy and reduces our carbon footprint. By choosing local suppliers, we can ensure the freshest ingredients and contribute to the well-being of our community.
          </li>
          <li className="sourcing-item">
            <strong>Transparency:</strong> We believe in full transparency. We know exactly where our ingredients come from and how they are produced, and we’re happy to share this information with our customers. Our commitment to transparency builds trust and allows our customers to make informed choices.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="sourcing-text">Through these practices, we ensure that every scoop of our gelato is not only delicious but also ethically and sustainably produced. We are proud to support responsible farming and fair trade, and we believe our customers can taste the difference.</p>
