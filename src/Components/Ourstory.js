      <p>
        "A Little Scoop of Happiness" started as a small family venture with a simple dream: to share our love for rich, creamy gelato with the community. Armed with traditional family recipes and a passion for quality, we began our journey with a single ice cream cart. Our early days were filled with long hours and hard work, but seeing the joy our gelato brought to people's faces made it all worthwhile. Each scoop we served was a step towards our dream of spreading happiness through exceptional ice cream.

        Our humble beginnings were marked by a deep commitment to using only the finest ingredients. We sourced fresh, local dairy and the highest quality flavorings to ensure that every scoop was a premium experience. Our dedication to excellence quickly gained us a loyal following, and word of mouth spread about the delightful flavors and creamy textures of our gelato. From those early days, "A Little Scoop of Happiness" became more than just a name; it became our mission.
