        <p className="key-ingredients-intro">At A Little Scoop of Happiness, we believe that the finest ingredients make the finest ice cream. Our commitment to quality starts with the selection of our key ingredients:</p>
        <ul className="key-ingredients-list">
          <li className="key-ingredient-item">
            <strong>Madagascar Vanilla Beans:</strong> Known for their rich, creamy flavor and sweet, floral aroma, our vanilla beans are handpicked and sun-cured to perfection. This lengthy curing process develops the beans' complex flavor profile, making them an ideal base for our classic Vanilla Gelato.
          </li>
          <li className="key-ingredient-item">
            <strong>Belgian Chocolate:</strong> We use premium Belgian chocolate, renowned for its smooth texture and intense cocoa flavor, to create our decadent chocolate ice creams. Our chocolate is sourced from a family-owned chocolatier in Belgium, ensuring each batch is crafted with care and tradition.
          </li>
          <li className="key-ingredient-item">
            <strong>Fresh Strawberries:</strong> Our strawberries are sourced from local farms, ensuring they are picked at the peak of ripeness for maximum flavor and sweetness. These berries are not only juicy and delicious but also packed with essential vitamins and antioxidants.
          </li>
          <li className="key-ingredient-item">
            <strong>Organic Milk and Cream:</strong> We use only the highest quality organic milk and cream, free from hormones and antibiotics, to give our gelato its signature creamy texture. Our dairy is sourced from cows that graze on lush pastures, providing rich and wholesome milk.
          </li>
          <li className="key-ingredient-item">
            <strong>Pure Cane Sugar:</strong> Our sweetener of choice is pure cane sugar, which adds a natural sweetness without any artificial aftertaste. This unrefined sugar retains its natural molasses, providing a deep, rich flavor that enhances our gelato.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="key-ingredients-conclusion">In addition to these key ingredients, we also use a variety of other high-quality ingredients to create our unique flavors, including freshly roasted nuts, exotic spices, and seasonal fruits.</p>
